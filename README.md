👋 **Hi there!**

🎓 I'm a 23 year old master's student at NTNU, studying Industrial Mathematics with a focus on Numerical Mathematics.

📜 Soon I'll be starting my thesis related to Physics-Informed Machine Learning.

🧑‍💻 I (mainly) code in 🐍Python and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLang/julia/master/doc/src/assets/julia.ico" width="15">Julia.

🎨 Besides mathematics I'm also quite interested in illustration and visual communication. Hopefully this might show in my plots from time to time.
